\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Idea 1:}} We filter out all photons with frequencies $f < f_{g} = \frac{w_{g}}{h}$ where $w_{g}$ is a band gap energy. These photons are not able to excite electrons and, thus,
contribute to useless energy reducing the efficiency of a solar cell.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textcolor{red}{Power of incident radiation} $P_{inc}$ is 

$$ P_{inc} = \int_{f_{g}}^{f_{max}}\frac{\partial P}{\partial f}df$$

where $f_{max}$ is the spectrum optimization parameter we are lookiand $f_{max} = \infty$ if the rest of the spectrum is accounted for. 

\vspace{0.2cm}

\textcolor{red}{Power delivered to the load} is
$$ P_{L} = \phi\cdot w_g  = f_{g}\cdot \int_{f_{g}}^{f_{max}}\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial P}{\partial f}df$$
where $\phi$ is the photon flux. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{We also assume that each photon contributes only energy $w_g$ to the electric output}}. 
%Then, solar cell efficiency is 
%$$ \eta = \frac{P_{L}}{P_{inc}} = \frac{f_{g}\cdot\int_{f_{g}}^{f_{max}}\frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial P}{\partial f}df}{\int_{f_{g}}^{f_{max}}\frac{\partial P}{\partial f}df}$$
